"""

Given an array of unique characters arr and a string str, Implement a function getShortestUniqueSubstring that finds the smallest substring of str containing all the characters in arr. Return "" (empty string) if such a substring doesnâ€™t exist.

Come up with an asymptotically optimal solution and analyze the time and space complexities.

Example:
input:  arr = ['x','y','z'], str = "xyyzyzyx"
output: "zyx"

#Below shows how I first imagined my code working
#NOTE: I pretty much did what I imagined, except start became "minIndex" and held the index of the lowest character, and the "end" wasn't necessary

#"xyyzyzyx"
#{x:0, start:"x", end:"x"}

#{x:0, y:2, z:3, start:"x", end:"z"}
#solution = (3 - 0) + 1 = 4

#{x:0, y:4, z:3, start:"x", end:"y"}
#length not less than solution

#{x:0, y:4, z:5, start:"x", end:"z"}
#length not less than solution

#{x:0, y:6, z:5, start:"x", end:"y"}
#length not less than solution

#{x:7, y:6, z:5, start:"z", end:"x"}
#length less than solution

#Three main steps
#1 See if there is a character match between the string and the array
#2 Add that character to strObject or update its position, and maybe update "minIndex"
#3 If all array characters have been found, record substring if its length is less than current

#NOTE: Main pseudocode is at the bottom
